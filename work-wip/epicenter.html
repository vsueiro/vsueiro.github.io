          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <p>In early 2020, when the first deaths related to the new coronavirus began to take place, we kept on hearing about those losses on the news ‚Äì often with a heavy heart.</p>
        <p>However, as the number of people losing their lives kept on increasing, our compassion towards those victims got dramatically reduced.</p>
        <p>Such effect is often defined as <a href="https://www.stephen-few.com/blog/2016/11/23/when-more-is-less-quantitative-numbing/" target="_blank">quantitative numbing</a>, which refers to a specific scenario of psychic numbing, a well-documented phenomenon.</p>
        <p>In order to fight back our indifference to the suffering of thousands of people, <i>‚ÄúAt the epicenter‚Äù</i> tried to place those numbers into a more human scale: our neighborhoods.</p>

          <figcaption>Early sketches (used to pitch the idea) compared to their final UI counterparts.</figcaption>

        <p>The project began when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalialevien/" target="_blank">Nat√°lia Leal</a>, CEO of <i>Ag√™ncia Lupa</i>, realized we needed a more emotional way of communicating the massive numbers of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>After putting together a team of 3 freelancers (myself included), we pitched the idea to Google News Initiative ‚Äì that would provide funding, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo" target="_blank">Alberto Cairo</a>‚Äôs creative direction.</p>
        <p>During the next 2 months (and after several prototypes), this tight-knit collaboration had resulted in a full-fledged web application, which was published on July 24, 2020.</p>
        <p>I was mainly responsible for the visual design and front end development of the website (using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript). In other words, I basically used coding to bring these screens to life:</p>

          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        </header>

        <p>One week after its launch, <i>‚ÄúAt the epicenter‚Äù</i> had more than 210,000 page views. Among those, 178,000 were unique users. But the most remarkable indicator is that those people spent, on average, 10 minutes and 54 seconds browsing the website ‚Äî way above market average.</p>

        <ul class="metrics">
          <li>
            <strong>200k +</strong>
            <span>Views</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>10 min +</strong>
            <span>Duration</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>On top of that, people really dove into the story: for every 100 people who began the narrative experience, 71 reached the end of it.</p>
        <p>I believe this high engagement is related to how unique the experience is for each user: after being prompted to enter their own address, users would see graphics and texts generated based on their geographic location.</p>
        <p>The main chart draws a circle around the user‚Äôs location, representing a radius of devastation. That circle is, then, filled with white dots, each one representing a death.</p>
        <p>Users could also download their own map as a custom <code>.jpg</code> poster, to be shared on social media, as showcased below (along with other written testimonials):</p>
