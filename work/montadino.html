          <h2>Context</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          At a school, you would probably see a rubber-like material being used
          by teachers and students.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the EVA foam – and you can use it to create costumes, to
          decorate the classroom and to aid in a number of educational
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>It’s colorful, soft, safe for kids and very resistant.</p>
        <p>
          Actually, this foam is so resistant that it would take around
          <strong>400 years</strong> for it to decompose in nature. This is
          usually the case with materials derived from crude oil.
        </p>
        <p>But how big is this problem?</p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at a real world example from a renowned school in Brazil –
          that was kind enough to provide information on their usage and
          disposal of this material.
        </p>

        <ul class="metrics">
          <li>
            <strong>1,200</strong>

            <strong>1</strong>
            <span>School Year</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For the last academic year, the school acquired over a thousand EVA
          foam sheets, in a wide range of colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so you can picture it better, each sheet has a surface of
          40&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60&nbsp;cm and measures 2&nbsp;mm in thickness.
        </p>
      </div>

          After usage, all of their remains go into recycling bins – there is
          one inside each classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a week, this material is then collected by a recycling
          cooperative. The point is that
          <strong>recycling EVA is difficult</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>So, in reallity, it usually ends up in a landfill.</p>
        <p>What can we do about it?</p>

        <p>
          If you walk into a kindergarten classroom, there would probably be a
          recycling bin laying on a corner.
        </p>
        <p>Now imagine there were also a bin only for of used EVA.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, imagine that waste sorting was a
          <strong>fun and enganing</strong> experience for kids… Like feeding a
          T-Rex!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flow max-800">
        <p>
          This white cardboard bin should help kids actively participate in
          waste sorting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Educators may use this moment as a
          <strong>learning opportunity</strong> for sustainability, so that
          students have a holistic view of the impact of their actions on the
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          All used EVA collected from schools would be sorted into 2 categories
          – each of them has a different destination:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Small scraps → Recycling partners</li>
          <li>Large scraps → Reuse (Dinosaurs!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The animation below depicts way how we could reuse sheets that were
          only partially compromised:

          Now imagine we repeated the process above with a few other EVA sheets.
          Doing so, we would obtain enough material to craft 2 dinosaur toys.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following animation shows the process of turning foam into
          dinosaur legs, arms, tails and more:

          The die cut process would leave remains like the ones below. They

          preschool period. The themes of interest are usually planes, trains or

          From a more realistic drawing on the left ← to the minimalist toy on
          the right →, there were a few steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second sketch aimed to reduce the dinosaur into its most basic
          shapes. This drawing was then refined on the computer – using only
          circles, rectangles and triangles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first physical prototypes were tiny wooden dinosaurs. They were
          made of <strong>laser cut</strong> MDF and used a toothpick for each
          axis. This is what they looked like:

        <p>
          That was until the son a of co&#8209;worker saw it there. He was
          obviously bored from being at the office and came to me asking about

          This kind of spontaneous feedback gave me confidence to refine the

          The next prototype was bigger and used laser cut EVA foam. Since this
          process leaves burn marks, it’s not suitable for final product
          manufacturing.
