              A social media post simulates a chat between a person and
              <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>. It explains why vaccination is important to prevent
              hospitals from being overwhelmed, which leads to people (Covid-19 patients, but also other patients) being
              left untreated. To explain that, the video uses an analogy of a cup (representing the capacity of a
              hospital), which is overflown with colored balls. Every ball represents a patient. Those who fell outside
              of the cup represent patients who were not able to get treatment due to overcrowded hospitals.

        Study https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/who-ecdc-nearly-half-million-lives-saved-covid-19-vaccination


        I am Sarah Tyler, a US citizen and a seasoned communications consultant on emergency responses,
        having worked for the United Nations (WHO/Europe) and various international organizations (Save the Children), 
        for the past 20 years. I am skilled in emergency communications, advocacy campaigns, humanitarian storytelling, 
        and media relations. My expertise lies in creating impactful advocacy communications for major crises like 
        the Turkey emergency, COVID-19, mpox, and refugee crises. As a strategic communicator, I offer expert advice to 
        senior leaders, orchestrate effective media strategies and campaigns, have acted as spokesperson for global NGOs,
        and was a journalist for the Associated Press.

        I met Mr. Sueiro during the hiring process for the Data Visualization Consultant position for WHO/Europe in 
        September of 2021. WHO/Europe was looking for a professional to turn raw technical data into stories and develop 
        data visualizations to illuminate new scientific evidence – and Mr. Sueiro was the ideal candidate.

        Mr. Sueiro worked for WHO/Europe for 3 months in a data visualization consultancy, and his content meaningfully 
        communicated scientific findings, in a clear way, for the general public in Europe. He created animated charts 
        and diagrams to communicate findings from a study by WHO and ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
        Control) that estimated that over 470 thousand lives had been saved by COVID-19 vaccination – in people over 
        60 years old – throughout the European Region. This project has been viewed over 3 million times on social 
        media and was even shared on Twitter by then First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon. Mr. Sueiro also 
        created a series of videos with animated graphics to explain the benefits of vaccination and protective 
        measures against COVID-19, as well as an automated software for translating those videos for other countries, 
        like Georgia and Ukraine, achieving around 10 million views across social media.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          In November of 2021, I began a 4-month collaboration with the
          <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> Regional Office for Europe (<a
            href="https://who.int/europe/"
            target="_blank"
            >WHO/Europe</a
          >) as a Data Visualization Consultant.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of the
          <a
            href="https://www.who.int/europe/teams/risk-communication--community-engagement-and-infodemic-management-(rci)-unit"
            target="_blank"
            >Risk Communication<span class="screen-reader">, Community Engagement and Infodemic Management</span></a
          >
          team, my goal was to <strong>turn raw technical data into stories</strong> and develop data visualizations to
          illuminate new scientific evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time there, I built internal tools, prototyped dozens of charts, and published 2 projects that I
          want to highlight in this case study:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Lives Saved</li>
          <li>Chat with WHO <small>(the thumbnail one)</small></li>
        </ul>

        <header>
          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          The deliverables for both those projects were short animated <i>videos</i> for social media – but here you’ll
          also see some <i>behind-the-scenes</i>, like early sketches and prototypes.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>Lives Saved</h3>

        <p>
          I created animated charts and diagrams to communicate how findings from a
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.47.2101021" target="_blank">study by WHO and ECDC</a>
          (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) that estimated that over
          <strong>470,000 lives had been saved</strong> by COVID-19 vaccination – in people over 60 years old –
          throughout the European Region.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final infographic looks <i>nothing</i> like the early prototype below, built in
          <a href="https://observablehq.com/" target="_blank">Observable</a> ↓

      <div class="flow max-800">
        <p>
          It was actually my first time using
          <a href="https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript" target="_blank"
            >“Observable JavaScript”</a
          >
          – and sharing its <a href="https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/">interactive notebooks</a> with
          the team was great for testing, as members could <b>play with different settings, colors, and filters</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ended up ditching the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple" target="_blank">small multiple</a> approach with
          <a href="https://datavizproject.com/data-type/percentage-grid/" target="_blank">waffle charts</a>, as it was
          too detailed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solution? A simple chart describing 2 scenarios: how many people would have died <i>with</i> and
          <i>without</i> vaccination.

        <h3>Chat with WHO</h3>

        <p>
          I also created a series of videos with animated graphics to explain the benefits of vaccination and protective
          measures against COVID-19.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea here was to simulate a conversation between the reader and WHO, using analogies and illustrations to
          convey the message. 💬
