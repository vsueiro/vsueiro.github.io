          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          In early 2020, when the first deaths related to the new coronavirus
          began to take place, we kept on hearing about those losses on the news
          ‚Äì often with a heavy heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as the number of people losing their lives kept on
          increasing, our compassion towards those victims got dramatically
          reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such effect is often defined as
          <a
            href="https://www.stephen-few.com/blog/2016/11/23/when-more-is-less-quantitative-numbing/"
            target="_blank"
            >quantitative numbing</a
          >, which refers to a specific scenario of psychic numbing, a
          well-documented phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to fight back our indifference to the suffering of thousands
          of people, <i>‚ÄúAt the epicenter‚Äù</i> tried to place those numbers into
          a more human scale: our neighborhoods.
        </p>

          The project began when
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalialevien/" target="_blank"
            >Nat√°lia Leal</a
          >, CEO of <i>Ag√™ncia Lupa</i>, realized we needed a more emotional way
          of communicating the massive numbers of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          After putting together a team of 3 freelancers (myself included), we
          pitched the idea to Google News Initiative ‚Äì that would provide
          funding, as well as

          >‚Äôs creative direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the next 2 months (and after several prototypes), this
          tight-knit collaboration had resulted in a full-fledged web
          application, which was published on July 24, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was mainly responsible for the visual design and front end
          development of the website (using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript). In
          other words, I basically used coding to bring these screens to life:

          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          One week after its launch, <i>‚ÄúAt the epicenter‚Äù</i> had more than
          210,000 page views. Among those, 178,000 were unique users. But the
          most remarkable indicator is that those people spent, on average, 10
          minutes and 54 seconds browsing the website ‚Äî way above market
          average.
        </p>

        <ul class="metrics">
          <li>
            <strong>200k +</strong>
            <span>Views</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>10 min +</strong>
            <span>Duration</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          On top of that, people really dove into the story: for every 100
          people who began the narrative experience, 71 reached the end of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe this high engagement is related to how unique the experience
          is for each user: after being prompted to enter their own address,
          users would see graphics and texts generated based on their geographic
          location.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main chart draws a circle around the user‚Äôs location, representing
          a radius of devastation. That circle is, then, filled with white dots,
          each one representing a death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users could also download their own map as a custom
          <code>.jpg</code> poster, to be shared on social media, as showcased
          below (along with other written testimonials):

          Besides applauding the clear narrative, judges also praised the story
          for providing a sense of scale regarding a statistic that people
          thought they already understood.

        <p>On a personal level, another judge wrote:</p>

        <blockquote>

            For me, the dots became more than a face in a crowd in a distant
            city ‚Äî they became every single one of my neighbors, the children
            playing in the street, the mail person, and my parents.
