            <h2>Context</h2>

            <p>When my wife an I moved to the United States, in 2022, we wanted to do things we couldn’t do in Brazil. And that included watching an NBA game in person.</p>

            <p>To celebrate our first wedding anniversary abroad, we did just that! We watched the Miami Heat play against the Detroit Pistons.</p>

            <p>By half time, the Heat was winning — but… they ended up losing by 22 points.</p>

            <p>Sure, comebacks like these happen… But how often?</p>

            <p>First, let’s take a look at what a comeback looks like. </p>
              
            <p>Back then, I didn’t know a chart like this existed, but this is the NBA’s <em>official</em> Lead Tracker:</p>
          </div>

          <div class="square max-1000" data-device="laptop">
            <figure>
              <a href="https://www.nba.com/game/det-vs-mia-0022200361/game-charts" target="_blank">
              <img
                src="/media/portfolio/personal/basketball/laptop-nba-lead-tracker.png"
                alt="Screen capture of the NBA Lead Tracker chart, showing the Miami Heat losing to the Pistons in the 2nd half"
                loading="lazy"
              />
              </a>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="flow max-800">
            <p>
              In this case, the red bars mean the Pistons were losing to the Heat — while the blue bars mean the Pistons were winning.
              The blue “mountain” on the right means the Pistons won, with a difference of 20-ish points.
            </p>
            <p>This is a good way to view the score of <strong>a game</strong> over time.</p>
            <p>But what if we could view a team’s <strong>whole season</strong>?</p>
          </div>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As you can imagine, I started sketching line charts. That should be our go-to for visualizing trends over time, right?</p>
            <p>At first, I considered only using a snapshop of the scores by the end of each quarter, like the drawing on the left:</p>
          </div>

          <div class="flow max-800">
            <figure class="media">
              <img
                src="/media/portfolio/personal/basketball/drafts-side.png"
                alt=""
                loading="lazy"
              />
              <figcaption>Early sketches</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <div class="flow max-800">
            <p>But why stop there? Why not visualize <em>every</em> time the scoreboard changed? On the rightmost sketch above, those overlapping lines are precisely that.</p>
            <p>So, just like the official tracker, I needed <strong>play-by-play</strong> data — which is a list of everything that happened in a game, along with the exact time it happened.</p>
            <p>A great source of NBA data is <a href="https://basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202212060MIA.html" target="_blank">basketball-reference.com</a>. This link will take you to that Heat game, the first one I attended. See that huge table? That’s play-by-play data.</p>
            <p>I then wrote a <a href="https://github.com/vsueiro/hoop-hills/blob/main/scraper/get-games.py">Python scraper</a> to automatically (and respectfully) extract those tables, turn them into a format I wanted, and save beautiful <code>.csv</code> in my <a href="https://github.com/vsueiro/hoop-hills" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
            <p>I scraped every play, by every NBA teams, across all seasons since 2015. This amounts to:</p>

            <ul class="metrics">
              <li>
                <strong>1.6M</strong> <!-- 3,317,680 datapoints / 2 -->
                <span>Plays</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>30</strong>
                <span>Teams</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>10+</strong>
                <span>Seasons</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>That’s a <em>lot</em> of numbers. How should I visualize all games of a season at once? How could interactivity help people navigate all those scores?</p>

          <div class="flow max-800">
            <p>From my first coded prototypes, it was clear that, if I wanted to explore my chart in 3D without distortions due to <em>perspective</em>, I had to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection" target="_blank">orthographic</a> camera.</p>
            <p>That camera creates “flat” views: objects far away would not seem smaller — they would be as big as closer ones. This provides a fair visual comparison, like a chart should.</p>
            <p>In other words, I could build a single data “sculpture”, and it could resemble 3 different charts when viewed from 3 different angles:</p>

            <p>From the front, it’s looks like a line chart that shows early leads (and trails).</p>
            <p>From one side, it’s a bar chart that shows the final point difference, and widest gaps during the game.</p>
            <p>From the top, it’s a heat map where you can easily spot games when, say, a 4th quarter lead was blown.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>To make sense and explore all those angles and insights, the visual interface went through a lot of changes.</p>
            <p>Since I’m both a designer and developer, I often enjoy creating functional prototypes early. That’s why the first <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> was basically a raw HTML form. But it gets better:</p>
