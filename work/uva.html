          <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> is an internal platform for replacing static JPG images with easy-to-embed &
          responsive graphics

          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          I pitched, designed, developed the UI of <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i>, an in-house tool for delivering great visual
          journalism for readers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before that, the few charts and information graphics that got published on <i lang="pt-BR">Estad√£o</i> were
          JPG images almost impossible to read on a smartphone.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that in mind, I gathered my colleagues and we started to outline the problem. We thought about the
          experience from different points of view:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Subscribers & readers</li>
          <li>‚ÄúPrint-first‚Äù graphic designers</li>
          <li>My ‚Äúdigital-first‚Äù dataviz team</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We decided to use an open source script for Adobe Illustrator, created by the The New York Times, called
          <a href="http://ai2html.org/" target="_blank">ai2html</a> , which basically ‚Äúconverts‚Äù information graphics
          crafted in Illustrator to HTML, for better accessibility and responsiveness.
        </p>

        <p>
          We got some feedback on the idea and designed the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> of the
          platform, that would allow graphic designers to <strong>upload custom charts</strong> ‚Äî drawn to fit up to
          four screen sizes ‚Äî and <strong>embed them</strong> inside articles.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="square outline max-1280" data-device="laptop">
        <figure>
          <img src="/media/portfolio/estadao/uva/home.png" alt="" />
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="flow max-800">
        <p>
          As you can see on the purple side bar above, the roadmap for <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> included many features
          (like automated charts), but let‚Äôs focus on the responsive Illustrator charts for now.
        </p>

        <p>
          We presented the project to my executive director and editor and they bought the idea. Let‚Äôs get into it üëá

          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          We started developing it from scratch, using a one week sprint workflow. The prioritization and backlog
          methods were all Scrum-inspired. After two months, we launched it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In less than two years after that, all the graphics published through <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> were viewed by
          more than 30 million users.

          It was a <strong>win for readers</strong>, who could better understand the facts through visual explanations.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a <strong>win for the ‚Äúprint-first‚Äù designers</strong>, who were losing space inside the company. Now
          they were creating & publishing mobile-ready infographics in minutes, daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was also a <strong>win for my team</strong>. We could now focus our efforts on more ambitious projects,
          like experimental data-driven narratives & advanced visualizations.
