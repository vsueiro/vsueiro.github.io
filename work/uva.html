              <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> is an internal platform for replacing static JPG images with easy-to-embed &
              responsive graphics
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
              I pitched, designed, developed the UI of <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i>, an in-house tool for delivering great
              visual journalism for readers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before that, the few charts and information graphics that got published on <i lang="pt-BR">Estad√£o</i>, a
              major Brazilian newspaper, were JPG images that were hard to read on a smartphone.
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words, the ‚Äúprint-first‚Äù graphics team was producing dozens of graphics daily, but for print. The
              few that got published online were often too small (imagine a fitting a 4-column infographic into an old
              iPhone screen).
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind, I gathered my ‚Äúdigital-first‚Äù graphics team and we started exploring solutions,
              thinking about the experience from 3 different points of view:
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
              <li>Subscribers & readers</li>
              <li>‚ÄúPrint-first‚Äù graphic designers</li>
              <li>My ‚Äúdigital-first‚Äù dataviz team</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We decided to use an open source script for Adobe Illustrator, created by the The New York Times, called
              <a href="http://ai2html.org/" target="_blank">ai2html</a>. It basically ‚Äúconverts‚Äù information graphics
              from Illustrator to HTML, for better accessibility and responsiveness.
            </p>

            <p>
              The idea was that the graphic designers could draw different versions of the same chart, with a clear
              mapping between column-based print layouts and web-based screen sizes. We made print & digital
              interchangeable.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a round of feeedback, we designed the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> of the
              platform, that would allow graphic designers to <strong>upload custom charts</strong> ‚Äî drawn to fit up to
              four screen sizes ‚Äî and <strong>embed them</strong> inside articles.
            </p>

              As you can see on the purple side bar above, the roadmap for <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> included many
              features (like automated charts), but let‚Äôs focus on the responsive Illustrator charts here.
            </p>

            <p>
              We presented the project to my executive director and editor ‚Äì and they were on board. Let‚Äôs get into it

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>

            <p>
              We started developing it from scratch, using a one week sprint workflow. The prioritization and backlog
              methods were all Scrum-inspired. After two months, we launched it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In less than two years after that, all the graphics published through <i lang="pt-BR">Uva</i> were viewed
              by more than 30 million users.

              It was a <strong>win for readers</strong>, who could better understand the facts through visual
              explanations.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was a <strong>win for the ‚Äúprint-first‚Äù designers</strong>, who were losing space inside the company.
              Now they were creating & publishing mobile-ready infographics in minutes, daily.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was also a <strong>win for my team</strong>. We could now focus our efforts on more ambitious projects,
              like experimental data-driven narratives & advanced visualizations.
