							<h2>Overview</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Among children living at a temporary home, you could probably find a 14-year-old black boy who has a brother or sister. These are the most common attributes of children available for adoption.</p>
							<p>However, the profile most sought out by future parents is that of a 2-year-old white girl and only child.</p>
							<p>According to our simulation, the 14-year-old‚Äôs chance of being adopted within 12 months is <strong>1 in 1,000</strong>. The girl‚Äôs adoption is taken for granted.</p>
							<p>In search for a more sensitive approach, we opted for a visual metaphor and represented each child as a small plant <span style="color: black">üåª</span> that grows as the years go by.</p>
							<!-- <p>In Brazil, couples that want to adopt children need to go through an extensive examination and backround check. After they are accepted into the adoption proccess, they also need to fill a form in which they declare which kind of child they are willing to take in. This is when characteristics such as age, existance of siblings, special needs, gender and race come into play.</p> -->
							<!-- <p>Long story short: the wannabe adoptive parents are looking for very specific traits. For most of the children and teenagers living at government foster homes, this makes the odds of moving in with a new family very low. Age is the most decisive factor: after one turns 10, the chances drop drastically. Along with that, having disabilities and siblings are also key factors.</p> -->
							<!-- <p>To show how parental preferences impact the likelihood of adoption, I‚Äôve developed a simulator that displays how long it would take for specific kid to be selected. Each child is represented as a plant that grows as time passes.</p> -->

							<p>When this story was published, the link between prospective parents and children available for adoption was manually performed by judges ‚Äì through their own spreadsheets, for example.</p>
							<p>But a new tool was on the horizon. It would match parents and children using an integrated national system.</p>
							<p>Inspired by this new system, I developed an <a href="https://github.com/estadao/simulador-de-adocao/blob/master/scripts/simulation.min.js" target="_blank">open source</a> simulator of our own, which also matches prospective parents and children.</p>

							<p>This simulator lets you interactively track <strong>how long</strong> it would take for a 2-year-old to be adopted ‚Äì and compare it with the waiting time of a 10-year-old.</p>
							<p>Users probably ran this simulation once. We have performed it <strong>thousands of times</strong>.</p>
							<p>Doing so, it was possible to identify the attributes that most facilitate or hinder the adoption of a child. Being over 5 years old, having siblings or some kind of disability makes adoption extremely difficult.</p>

							<p>We then compared the characteristics of children available for adoption with those of children who were adopted. This indicates that, although skin color plays an important role during selection, there are other more selective filters in action.</p>
							<p>For example, almost half of the children with cognitive impairments are not adopted. In addition, children that have brothers or sisters are much less likely to be adopted if they are over 10.</p>

							<p>White kids are accepted by 92% of the prospects, but only 56% of them accept black boys and girls. Also, children that have at least one brother or sister are only accepted by 37% of the prospective parents.</p>
							<p>These numbers don‚Äôt add up when you compare them with the Brazilian population, from babies to teenagers.</p>
