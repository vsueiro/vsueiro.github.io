          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          Among children living at a temporary home, you could probably find a
          14-year-old black boy who has a brother or sister. These are the most
          common attributes of children available for adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the profile most sought out by future parents is that of a
          2-year-old white girl and only child.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to our simulation, the 14-year-old‚Äôs chance of being adopted
          within 12 months is <strong>1 in 1,000</strong>. The girl‚Äôs adoption
          is taken for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In search for a more sensitive approach, we opted for a visual
          metaphor and represented each child as a small plant üåª that grows as
          the years go by.

          When this story was published, the link between prospective parents
          and children available for adoption was manually performed by judges ‚Äì
          through their own spreadsheets, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a new tool was on the horizon. It would match parents and children
          using an integrated national system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by this new system, I developed an
          <a
            href="https://github.com/estadao/simulador-de-adocao/blob/master/scripts/simulation.min.js"
            target="_blank"
            >open source</a
          >
          simulator of our own, which also matches prospective parents and
          children.

          This simulator lets you interactively track
          <strong>how long</strong> it would take for a 2-year-old to be adopted
          ‚Äì and compare it with the waiting time of a 10-year-old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users probably ran this simulation once. We have performed it
          <strong>thousands of times</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By doing so, it was possible to identify the attributes that most
          facilitate or hinder the adoption of a child. Being over 5 years old,
          having siblings or some kind of disability makes adoption extremely
          difficult.

            After running the simulation up until a total of 1,000 children were
            adopted, we grouped them by different categories: race, disability
            and siblings.

          We then compared the characteristics of children available for
          adoption with those of children who were adopted. This indicates that,
          although skin color plays an important role during selection, there
          are other more selective filters in action.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, almost half of the children with cognitive impairments
          are not adopted. In addition, children that have brothers or sisters
          are much less likely to be adopted if they are over 10.

            When a couple or a single person is able to apply for the adoption
            process, it is necessary for them to define the attributes of the
            desired child. These decisions involve maximum age, sex, race and
            many others.

      <div class="flow max-800">
        <p>Just to name a couple of discrepancies:</p>
        <p>
          White kids are accepted by 92% of the prospects, but only 56% of them
          accept black boys and girls. Also, children that have at least one
          brother or sister are only accepted by 37% of the prospective parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          These numbers don‚Äôt add up when you compare them with the Brazilian
          population, from babies to teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this kind of problem, a Brazilian senator spoke up the at

          Besides publishing a delicate visual story about adoption, our
          underlying goal was to promote a shift in perception, so that those
          charts and numbers could look ‚Äì a few years from now ‚Äì a bit
