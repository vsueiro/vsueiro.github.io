        </header>

        <p>
          A dear friend of mine was specializing in data journalism at the Columbia University J-School in New York
          City. As a course assignment,
          <a href="https://meneg.at/" target="_blank">Rodrigo Menegat</a> was about to write his first story using
          Python for analysing data.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, here in Brazil, I was eager to experiment with new ways of communicating visual information.</p>
        <p>As you can imagine, we decided to partner up.</p>
        <p>
          Rodrigo was initially astonished by the amount of government purchases that were kept secret ‚Äì that is, you
          know how much was spent, but not what was bought.
        </p>
        <p>Although this was interesting, there had to be a more compelling way of putting the word out‚Ä¶</p>

          <li>How can we approach a dataset in a way that will make people feel connected to it?</li>

        <p>You‚Äôre probably not very familiar with bidding processes, but you sure know how much a meal should cost.</p>
        <p>From a narrative standpoint, this was a cool way of introducing a boring subject.</p>
        <p style="width: 100%">It was time to get visual.</p>

          If you like to speak nerdy, the chosen chart type is called jitterplot ü§ì ‚Äì which is a scatterplot with
          discrete values on one axis.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, what matters is that each dot represents a stakehouse dinner bought with public money.</p>
        <p>
          The magic touch was using a <strong>blend mode</strong> called ‚Äúsoft light‚Äù on each dot. Doing so, every
          overlapping dot became brighter and brighter ‚Äì which resulted in this fiery look üî•. Check the effect in

        <p>As this visual essay was independently published, it had only been viewed a few thousand times.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, these flames were able to generate a tiny buzz inside the dataviz community.</p>

          I guess it all started when this project won a medal at the Kantar

            I think my choice for most beautiful chart design goes to this investigative piece on how much the Brazilian
            government spends on federal barbecues. Combining fiery visuals and flames in a bar chart is genius.

          It‚Äôs funny because this project was also featured on the
          <a href="https://dataviztoday.com/" target="_blank">Data Viz Today</a>
          podcast by
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisontorban/" target="_blank">Alli Torban</a>
          and, to be honest, it‚Äôs almost like she understood this project better than the people involved in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a few minutes, I highly recommend listening to her show ‚Äì in which she breaks down projects from
          around the world and provides actionable tips from the lessons learned.
